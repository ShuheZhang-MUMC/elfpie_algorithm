## This Folder contains raw image data for FPM experiment.

A total of 64 images (Squared LEDs array, 8 by 8 LEDs) was collected. <br>
System parameters:

LED height: 180 mm <br>
LED distant: 8 mm <br>

NA = 0.1 <br>
lambda = 0.532 <br>
Maginification = Ã—3 <br>
pixel-element size 3.45 um <br>

run **pross_old.m** to cut a certain block from the collected images. <br>
those images will be saved in "pross" Folder

#### incohren_1024.png (normalized) is the average value of those 64 images which can be regarded as the incoherence illumination output.
#### ORG.png is the direct upsampling of the first image.
